# Dirty Dishes
Dirty Dishes gives you a quick, simple picture of a King County restaurant's food inspection score and what others thought of the restaurant so you can make a more informed decision on where you're about to eat. Keep in mind that inspection reports are snapshots of the food handling at the establishment at the time of inspection â€“ conditions may be different when you visit. Check out the Washington State Department of Health for more information.

I built this app using a MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node), bootstrap, and the Food Establishment Inspection Data API. I wanted to create this app because I would like to see a letter grading system for restaurants established in Seattle.
