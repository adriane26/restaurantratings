		<h1> About <span class="dirtyDishFont">Dirty Dishes</span></h1>
		<p><span class="dirtyDishFont">Dirty Dishes</span> gives you a quick, simple picture of a restaurant's food inspection score and what others thought of the restaurant so you can make a more informed decision on where you're about to eat. Based on the inspection score, I assigned each restaurant a letter grade: 0-20 points = A, 21-45 points = B, 46-60 = C, and 60+ = F. Keep in mind that inspection reports are snapshots of the food handling at the establishment at the time of inspection â€“ conditions may be different when you visit.

		<h1>The Creator</h1>
		<p>My name is Adriane. I am a web developer based in Seattle, WA. I built this app using a MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node), bootstrap, and the Food Establishment Inspection Data API. I wanted to create this app because I would like to see a letter grading system for restaurants established in Seattle. </p>
